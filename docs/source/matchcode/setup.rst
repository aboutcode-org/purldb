MatchCode.io Setup
==================

MatchCode.io requires that it is installed and running alongside an instance of
PurlDB, as it needs direct access to PurlDB's data. This is done by running the
PurlDB and MatchCode.io services on the same Docker network. The MatchCode.io
web server is connected to PurlDB's database and its own MatchCode.io database.
