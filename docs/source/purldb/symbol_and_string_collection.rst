Symbol and String Collection
============================

The package indexing endpoint supports the ScanCode.io source code symbol and string collection
pipeline and stores them in the ``extra_data`` field of the resource model.


What are symbols?
------------------

Source code symbols are the names of the functions, methods, classes, varibales and data structures
as found in source code. Another name is "identifiers". Source code iterals (or "strings") are the
string values of variables, such as messages asssigned to a variable or constant in the source code
of a program.

Why would you want to collect source symbols?
-----------------------------------------------

Symbols and literals are important identifiers of the source code that are useful for:

- Finding similar source code, that uses the same symbols, while abstracting the code formatting
- Finding source code references in compiled, transpiled or minified "binaries".


How it works
------------

When PurlDB receives an index request for a PURL via the ``/api/collect`` endpoint along with the
symbol/string addon_pipeline, it fetches the archive download_url and creates a package for the PURL
with relevant metadata.

Thereafter, a scan job is scheduled which downloads the archive of the PURL and runs the
`scan_single_package
<https://scancodeio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/built-in-pipelines.html#scan-single-package>`_
package pipeline.

Scan job also runs the requested addon_pipelines.
Upon completion of the scan job, the package is updated with resource data along
with the ``source_symbols`` and ``source_strings`` in the ``extra_data`` field of resources.

Currently PurlDB supports these addon_pipeline for symbol/string collection.

- ``collect_symbols_ctags``
- ``collect_strings_gettext``
- ``collect_symbols_tree_sitter``
- ``collect_symbols_pygments``

See the detailed tutorial on :ref:`symbols_and_strings` in PurlDB.
