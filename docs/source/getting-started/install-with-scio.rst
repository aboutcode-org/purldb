Installation with ScanCode.io
===============================

Installation documentation to set up purldb and SCIO instances together so we have:

- a main SCIO server for scanning and matching code
- a PurlDB instance for storing package scans and matching data
- SCIO workers for the purldb instance to scan and index packages.
