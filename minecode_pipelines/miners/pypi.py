"""
Visitors for Pypi and Pypi-like Python package repositories.

We have this hierarchy in Pypi simple/ index:
    pypi projects (JSON/HTML) -> project versions (JSON/HTML) -> download urls

https://pypi.org/simple/
Pypi serves a main index via JSON/HTML API that contains a list of package names
and some info on when a package was updated by releasing a new version.
See https://docs.pypi.org/api/index-api/ for more details.
This index also has a list of versions and download URLs of all
uploaded/available package archives and some basic metadata.

https://pypi.org/pypi/{name}/json
For each package, a JSON contains details including the list of all releases
and archives, their URLs, and some metadata for each release.
For each release, a JSON contains details for the released version and all the
downloads available for this release.
