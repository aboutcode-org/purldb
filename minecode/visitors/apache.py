Collect data from Apache.org.
There are two primary sources of data:

1. directory listings of the downloads distribution web site apache.org/dist
   and archive.apache.org. These map well to packages but we get little or no
   data beside a checksum and some name and painfully extracted version.
   This data could also be fetched for the most recent ones (since 2012) from:
   https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ which is an SVN repo
   And svn ls -R https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ could be more
   efficient and easier to parse incrementally?

2. JSON data collated by the Foundation to provide project information. These
   are for projects and do not map very well to a package or download (but
   rather to several of thems at once)

The JSON data comes from https://projects.apache.org/about.html and
is created with this code:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/trunk/ .

This JSON data is project-level except for releases-files.json .. but this is
just based on parsing the find-ls directory listing so bring nothing new.

- http://home.apache.org/public/public_ldap_projects.json : seems to be the
  origin for the projects.json and podlings.json data

- These is a list of VCS repositories. Each key maps rather well to a package
  name. But the key (some package name?) may not match a project:
  https://projects.apache.org/json/foundation/repositories.json
  This comes from http://git.apache.org/

- This more or less maps to top-level projects but does not relate to packages
  https://projects.apache.org/json/foundation/committees.json

- This list podling projects with only few details and does not map to packages
  https://projects.apache.org/json/foundation/podlings.json

- This should contain an entry for each project but does not. Yet each JSON
  contains also the releases.json and repositories.json content for that project.
  https://projects.apache.org/json/projects/

- This seems to be the origin of most project data:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/trunk/data/projects.xml

- Another source of the JSON may be:
  https://whimsy.apache.org/public/
